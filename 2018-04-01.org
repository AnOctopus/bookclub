* notes
  Met on the LH roof
  - lex read a speech from Network (posted in #irl)
** amortization
   How do people deal with bad things?
   - experiences can be/are lumped together
   - the actually painful part of pain comes from trying to ignore it
   - you can deal with an experience by paying attention to it, to make it more okay
   - it's also possible to handle experiences by ignoring them completely
     - "I'm too busy to pay attention to this, handle it for me" (attention talking to other processing thing in the brain)
     - this saves attention but costs mana/energy
     - turns loud noises from painful to tiring
** aesthetic concordance
   should presenting an idea be done on just the explicit communication channel or should others (emotion and style stuff) be used to convey information
   - being concordant communicates the idea faster and maybe better
   - using only the explicit channel means using others for conveying calm safety
   - lex sees value in using only the explicit channel because the others cause bayesian updates about the topic automatically
     - other channels can't always consent, can't choose to fully reject the idea after seeing it
     - some people need calm signals on other channels to be able to even consider the idea
   - bookclub used upfront blanket consent + iterated consent via exit rights to get permission to use other channels to speed things up
     - need a model of ethics for deciding when it's ok to use these channels without consent
   - "I think my body has the right to consent"
     - other parts of you can consent sometimes
     - inner animal making negotiations to fulfill its needs
** how to make friends
   - friends come mainly from people you see occasionally already
   - just talk to them
     - talk about something you have in common, something they did/made/wrote/etc that you liked
     - be specific if referring to their stuff
   - friendship involves mutual emotional support, daniel signals not being able/willing to provide that
   - the cost of just messaging someone you kinda know out of the blue is much lower than you think
   - and the rewards are higher
   - if someone becomes your friend, they benefit too. not a selfish thing to make friends
