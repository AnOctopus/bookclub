* Lex bookclub (CFAR) notes
  Focus is on Daniel, who is starting from an almost blank slate due to autism-related lack of socialization (socially a baby)
  Building a social sense
** Masks, as per Impro
   used by most people pervasively
   can partially substitute with scripts and rituals, but not flexible
** Hidden modeling modules
   - people give lots of signals
     you can pick out a friendly programmer on a train w/o relying on an explicit programming reference on their shirt
   - Sidewalk practice: walk on a crowded sidewalk and change your posture to make people walk out of your path or walk into you
     goal is not to walk. goal is to see how to manipulate social signals, and observe differences in what kinds of people react in what ways
*** themes/aesthetics
   - processing themes uses the same modules as social modeling
   - jade connected to hers after watching a bunch of anime reviews that critiqued art/theme stuff
   - aesthetic blogging practice
     run an aesthetic/art blog. categorize the stuff you reblog. let the categories change over time
     suggested in particular for daniel (to build up the connection), jess (to refine it), and amanda (to build connection to emotionstuff)
** internalized nonhostility
    need to be able to be hostile even if you almost never use it
    otherwise people can take advantage of you by making requests in bad faith and you won't be able to defend yourself without guilt
  - bad faith example
    father using laziness as a guilt source to push him into taking a higher course load than he wants
    lots of bad faith examples from parents, for most of us
** psychoticism
   being transfeminine is a huge risk factor, even after the mitigation factor of estrogen
* post-lex discussion notes
  jess and amanda have made rapid progress in learning this stuff over the last few months
  glass is developing it much slower
  - belief/value ossification
    glass is by default high psychoticism, built a defensive structure to enforce more consistency
    prevents things like lsd insights from sticking
    basically makes her like amanda
  - amanda's default state is/was v low psychoticism
    this effect was reduced by [therapy]
