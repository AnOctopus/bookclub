* 2018-03-04 book club notes
  Intended to start off with something other than "Not believing everything people tell you 101" so Alison will get to engage a bit
  She has the opposite problem, due to noticing being lied to during formative years

  People have incentives to do what they say, but incentives pushing in other directions are usually stronger
** Processing/checking multiple levels in a statement
   Most statements don't make complete sense or aren't coherent
   They don't have an actual truth value
   Statement incoherence is not the main factor for statements not having a truth value
   People make claims they don't really believe often
   - they will concede the nontruth if asked
   - but they will say them anyway
   - idioms and aphorisms intended to convey information about the speaker but not be factual statements/claims
   conversations as information exchange vs conversations for group cohesion or enjoyment
** A giraffe is a banana
   how you respond to this statement tells other people a lot about you
   - accepting
   - metaphor
   - confused/questioning
     This kind of response, given by daniel, says a lot about what kind of person he is
     lex says he could predict the kind of shirt daniel was wearing based on it
** aesthetic sorting
   daniel's examples had a clear aesthetic but mostly lacked execution (not generally pretty)
** role stuff
   Michael said that daniel is explicitly interested in learning this/making updates, but implicitly interested in _not_ learning it
   it's scary/threatening and makes you deal with bad things and consider making big changes (like dropping out of college)
   Daniel should try to use a mask to get into a role other than his current one that believes everything people say
   WWI vet, predatory vampires considered and rejected
   Tried a Skitter mask, but didn't break his role because nobody else was in character
   Tried doing things out of character
   - watering plants
   - cutting off some of lex's hair with a knife
   - weed suggested
*** playing each other
    everyone tries to be the person to their right (very difficult, mostly you get caricatures at best, freezing or blatantly ooc at worst)
    tried groups
    - 3 people each being lex, nyx, and daniel
    - talking about talking/communication
    paying attention to convo + imitating people generatively is hard
    responding to queries is easier during imitation than generating new stuff and interjecting
    lex says he can't pay attention to people and do the heavy thinking/modeling/imitation either
    olivia always has to pay attention to that stuff, internal narratives, etc. very expensive
** getting into a mask
   people talk/act differently around different people
   but this doesn't mean they're using a mask
   might just be using a thin translation layer
** local application problem
   daniel asked how he can stop being his role and start being his true self
   - the very question shows that he doesn't quite get it
   tendency:
   - daniel is presented with a model of something in the context of a problem
   - attempts to use the model to generate a solution
   - the solution is technically valid but badly misses the point
   the models here should be applied to lots of situations and problems, not just the one that prompted the model
   they should be integrated into bigger social models
